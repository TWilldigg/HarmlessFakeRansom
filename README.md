# HarmlessFakeRansom
Harmless Splashscreen written in C# &amp; WinForms & Python. A project by TWilldigg & Jkerai1

This will generate a windows form with no toolbar displaying a fake ransomware message.It is purely cosmetic. The address is not real, please do NOT try to send money to it.  

There is also an python "encrypter" that will generate fake encrypted files on the user's desktop. These files are empty and meaningless.



# Possible Improvements
- Call python script from c# for all in one package

# HarmlessFakeRansom - A project by TWilldigg & Jkerai1
Harmless Splashscreen written in C# &amp; WinForms & Python.

This will generate a windows form with no toolbar displaying a fake ransomware message. It is purely cosmetic. The address is not real, please do NOT try to send money to it.  

There is also an fake python "encrypter" (FakeEncrypter.py) that will generate fake encrypted files (.encrypted) on the user's desktop. These files are empty and meaningless. You can edit the text that is generated for the names of the files. The variable is helpfully called "text".



# Possible Improvements
- Call python script from c# for all in one package
